<h1>Data science Task - 1</h1>
<h2>Project : Detecting fake news</h2>

<h4>Name : Rahul Singh</h4> 


Objective: Differentiate between real and fake news using a Python project applying a passive-aggressive classifier.
Detecting fake news is a critical challenge in today's information age. In this project, we will use Python to build a machine learning model to differentiate between real and fake news. We will apply a passive-aggressive classifier, a popular algorithm for text classification. By the end of this project, you will have a better understanding of data exploration, model building, and performance evaluation in text classification.
